# Master script to run statistical analyses

# 1. Exploratory visualisations and ordinations
## track down outliers and correct the data

# 2. for Aphid traits:
## 2.1 Linear models to partition variance among colonies/plots:
## 2.2 Linear models testing for difference in traits between urban vs rural plots
## 2.3 Linear models testing for a linear relationship between traits and % Sealing

# 3. for Plant traits:
## 3.1 Linear models to partition variance among colonies/plots:
## 3.2 Linear models testing for difference in traits between urban vs rural plots
## 3.3 Linear models testing for a linear relationship between traits and % Sealing

# 4. for Aphid colony parameters (aphid nb, ants)

## 4.2 Linear models testing for difference in colony parameters between urban vs rural plots
## 4.3 Linear models testing for a linear relationship between  colony parameters and % Sealing

# 5. Relationship/covariations between aphid and plant traits
